# Simple Blog as an introduction to React and Full-stack Web Development

Here is an application created to be an introduction to React and full stack web development. The application allows for one to post or retrieve all postings by a certain filter(Date or Category). It introduces React routers, react components, MongoDB and Express.JS. I will be posting an article attached to it in the upcoming days!

## Getting Started
Feel free to fork the project and add any changes to it

### Prerequisites

```
You will first need the latest version of node on your system.
Remember to npm install after downloading the project!
The project also requires you to have your mlab or a local mongodb database.

```
